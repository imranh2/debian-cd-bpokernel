# debian-cd-bpokernel
Script to make a debian dist install CD but with dist-backports kernel

Need to install debian stable on a machine? Kernel too old for your hardware? Backports kernel new enough? This script will help you if you answered yes to all of those.

* Make sure you have sudo installed.
* This script assumes that target dist == dist on your build machine
* Also assumes you have backports enabled
